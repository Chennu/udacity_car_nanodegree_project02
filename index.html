<p>Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set.</p>

<p>These bar charts illustrate the distributions of the training, validation, and test sets, respectively.  At a glance, these three sets seem to be distributed similarly across the 43 sign types.</p>

<p>My pre-processing was simple: for each of the 3 color channels (RGB), I modified the values as <code>(pixel - 128.) / 128.</code>.  This ensures that the pixel values are in [-1, 1].  Normalizing the data is important because it helps to avoid a poorly conditioned optimization problem.  Moreover, by normalizing in this manner we retain all of the information about the images, since we could always convert back to the original images via <code>normalized_pixel * 128. + 128.</code>.  As such, there is no reason to display an image of a pre-processed image – it is simply a shifted and rescaled version<br>
of the original.</p>
<p>I tried using the mean µ and the standard deviation σ to rescale the images so that they had mean zero and standard deviation one, but this did not work as well as the simpler rescaling approach.  I suspect that this is because color is an important feature in this classification problem, and so standardizing the images to all have the same average pixel intensity results in a loss of valuable information.</p>

<p>For training, I used dropout on each of these layers.</p>

Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.</h4>
<p>I used 50 epochs for training the model.  Initially I used 10, but I found that more epochs were needed in order to achieve a higher accuracy.  I also tried 100 epochs but found that it did not provide any improvement over 50 epochs.</p>
<p>I used the same optimizer, <code>tf.train.AdamOptimizer</code>, as in the LeNet lab.</p>
<p>I used <code>rate = 0.001</code> for the learning rate; I tried using <code>rate = 0.0001</code> but the results were not as good.</p>
<p>For dropout, I used <code>keep_prob = 0.9</code> when training, which I found delivered better results than using <code>keep_prob = 0.5</code> or not using dropout at all.</p>

<p>I started with the LeNet model, making 2 simple modifications so that it is applicable to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>I modified it to accept an input with a depth of 3 (32x32x3) instead of 1 (32x32x1), since we are working with RGB images and not grayscale images.</li>
<li>I changed the length of the output to 43 (the number of sign types), not 10 (the number of digits).</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose to use LeNet as a starting point for this problem because it was designed for image classification (specifically, handwritten digits) on small images (32x32), and so I felt that it should work well for classifying traffic signs in small images (again, 32x32).  One of the reasons why LeNet performs well at its image classification task is due to its use of convolutional layers, as they are translation invariant and can detect features regardless of where they are in the image.  However, while the input for LeNet are grayscale images, I opted to use color images as my input because the color of the signs should provide useful information for classifying them.  I also introduced dropout into the model in order to achieve higher accuracy.</p>
<p>From here, the following table details in chronological order the steps that I took to arrive at my final model:</p>

<p>Only when I was satisfied with the validation accuracy did I evaluate my model on the test set.  Thus, the test set had no influence on the selection and training of the model.</p>
<p>My final model results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>training set accuracy of 100.0%</li>
<li>validation set accuracy of 95.6%</li>
<li>test set accuracy of 94.8%</li>

<p>Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:</p>
<p><img src="new_images.png" alt="sign_examples.png"></p>
<p>I cropped these to be square and also so that the sign is centered in the image.</p>
<p>To be honest, all of these images are pretty easy to classify and it’s not surprising that the model achieved 100% accuracy on them.  This is simply because a Google image search for “German traffic signs” yields pretty clear and high quality images of German traffic signs.  In fact, these images seem to be more clear than the training set images, as seen above.</p>

<p>The model achieved 100% accuracy on this new set of images, which is consistent with the 95.6% and 94.8% accuracies that it achieved on the validation and testing sets, respectively.  Given the simplicity of the images, it would be worrisome if the model incorrectly labeled any of the traffic signs.</p>

<p>As copy &amp; pasted from the output of cell 24 in my Jupyter notebook, the softmax probabilities:</p>
<pre><code>[[  1.00000e+00   5.13824e-08   4.68345e-09   9.60071e-12   5.32794e-12]

<p>The model is over 99.9999% certain for each of the 5 new images.  The image above shows each of the new images (first column) along with the top 5 images according to their softmax probabilities.  What I find most surprising is how certain the model is that the last new image (18 = “general caution”) is not a “traffic signals” (26) sign, since these appear to be pretty similar to my human eye.</p>
